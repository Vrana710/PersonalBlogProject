                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Varsha R. Rana, and I am passionate about the timeless wisdom
                            contained
                            within the Bhagavad Gita. I created this blog to share my journey and insights, and to
                            connect with
                            others who are interested in this profound text.</p>
                        <p>My journey with the Bhagavad Gita began 1 month ago when I first encountered its teachings.
                            Since then, it has been a guiding light in my life, offering clarity, peace, and direction.
                            I have
                            studied various translations and commentaries, and continue to find new depths of
                            understanding with
                            each reading.</p>
